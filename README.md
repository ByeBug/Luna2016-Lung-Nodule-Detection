# Luna2016-Lung-Nodule-Detection
Course Project for Bio Medical Imaging: Detecting Lung Nodules from CT Scans

This project was inspired by the LUNA 2016 Grand Challenge that uses low-dose CT scans for pulmonary nodule detection in lung scans.

We use a U-net Convolutional Neural Network for lung nodule detection.
